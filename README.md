# Artificial-Intelligence-CRISP
CRISP-DM - The Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining- A Project built using AI models

## About the Authors

- Varun H Shamaraju — Data scientist and AI practitioner focused on building end-to-end ML solutions using CRISP-DM. Varun leads data preparation, modeling experiments, and evaluation workflows. Interests: predictive modeling, feature engineering, and model interpretability.

- Swaroop K — Machine learning engineer with experience in deploying ML pipelines and automating data workflows. Swaroop focuses on reproducible experiments, MLOps practices, and scalable model deployment. Interests: production ML, CI/CD for models, and model monitoring.

## Data Source

Data is fetched using the [yfinance](https://github.com/ranaroussi/yfinance) API, a popular open-source Python library that provides a reliable and Pythonic way to download historical market data from Yahoo Finance.

The pipeline applies lightweight data-mining steps such as cleaning, resampling, basic feature extraction (returns, moving averages, volatility) and labeling, with reproducible processing tracked for auditability.
